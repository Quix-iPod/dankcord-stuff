Welcome to the official DankPods Community Discord guild, a place to discuss DankPods, audio gear, iPods and other topics. We hope you'll enjoy your stay here, but first off, we need you to read and abide by the rules listed below, as well as faq.

1. Respect
    Don't be racist, homophobic, transphobic, sexist or otherwise engage in hate speech. You can curse, but just don't be a jerk to others. This includes offensive memes.

2. Be mature
    Please act mature in any discussions here. Don't spam, or clog general up with unnecessary messages. Don't shitpost in chat and break up conversations. 

3. Be inclusive
    If someone asks you to stop discussing a sensitive topic, stop. We're trying to make this a friendly place.

4. Think before you type
    If you think a message might be offensive to others, just don't send it.

5. Keep stuff to the correct channels
    For example, keep memes to #memes. It's fine if you post something better fitting to another channel to general once, but don't clog up the channel, take it to the relevant one. Also, keep #audio-help to serious discussion.

6. Follow Discord TOS
    Every member here needs to follow the Discord Terms of Service, for example, their age requirement. (<https://discord.com/terms>)

7. NSFW Content
    Keep Not Safe For Work content out of this guild. There are underage people here, and plus, it's not something most people want to see.

8. Illegal Content
    We don't allow illegal content to be posted in this guild in any form, and will report it to the relevant authorities. This includes piracy, such as Patreon-exclusive content. Don't post links to it or direct files.

9. Self-promotion
    Don't advertise your own content here. This includes streams, YT channels and Discord guild invites. This rule may not be enforced if the content is relevant to the discussion.

10. Drama
    Don’t bring drama from other communities or your personal life here. We are not therapists; seek help through the appropriate channels IRL.”

11. Malware
    Malware is not allowed to be uploaded in this guild. This includes images with malware inside of them, since they may still trigger antimalware software.

12. Politics
    Politics are not allowed in this server, since it usually devolves into arguments. 

13. Impersonation
    Impersonating people, including a moderator or DankPods, is not allowed.

14. Language
    This server is an English-speaking only server. It allows us to moderate the server without misunderstandings in language.

15. Drugs 
    This server does not allow any sort of discussions involving drugs or other substances. 

Punishment Guidance
    Generally, we operate on a 3-strikes-you're-out system, starting with a warning, mute (length up to mod discretion) and finally a temporary or permanent ban.
However, this guidance might be broken according to the acting moderator. This means that, for example, if you clearly are joining just to troll, or are posting slurs/NSFW content, we may ban you on the spot, or, in the case of minimal rule breakage, we may give a non-strike verbal warning.

Automoderator warnings (e.g posting a blacklisted word) don't count as strikes, neither do "joke" infractions (e.g asked to be muted/warned). Normally, if you get a legitimate strike, we will append (X/3) to the infraction message. Strikes may also be removed at mod discretion for continued good behaviour. For any numbered strike appeals (1/3, 2/3), please DM any moderator and request the appeal form. For bans please stick to the ban appeal form that is attached with DankBot's infraction DM.
